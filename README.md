# AlephReloaded
A simple Leiningen project that opens an echo websocket using Aleph and Component

A lot of inspiration from https://github.com/juxt/edge

To run:

```
lein repl

user=> (reset)
```

I have only used this project with CIDER/Emacs and `lein repl` - which means I have never tried to deploy this code yet.

Improvements and suggestions welcome.
